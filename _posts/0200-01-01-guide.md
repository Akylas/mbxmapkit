MBXMapKit is a toolset for building mapping applications for iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices on Apple's platforms. It is based on Apple's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference) framework, but with much greater flexibility for visual styling and offline use -- plus it's open source.

# Installation

MBXMapKit supports iOS versions 7.0 and higher and OS X versions 10.9 and higher. 

## CocoaPods

Follow these steps in order to use the MBXMapKit within your own Xcode 5 project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). This is the easiest installation method if you are familiar with CocoaPods. 

 1. Obtain the map ID for your hosted map by clicking **Publish** and copying the **Map ID**. 
 1. Ensure that your `Podfile` is targeting `:ios` and `'7.0'` or `:osx` and `10.9`.
 1. Add a line containing `pod 'MBXMapKit'` to your `Podfile`.
 1. Run `pod install` in the Terminal.
 1. At a minimum, `#import <MBXMapKit/MBXMapKit.h>` and instantiate an `MBXMapView` in your code using the `-initWithFrame:mapID:` initializer and an `NSString` made from your **Map ID** obtained above.

## Source

Follow these steps in order to use MBXMapKit within your own Xcode 5 project while retaining the ability to edit the library source as you go. This is the most flexible installation method if you want to be able to modify the source code of the library. 

 1. Obtain the map ID for your hosted map by clicking **Publish** and copying the **Map ID**. 
 1. Copy the library source code from the [repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mbxmapkit).
 1. Add `MBXMapKit.h` and `MBXMapKit.m` to your project's file sources, either by dragging them into your project from Finder or via `File > Add Files...`, in order to make the library available to your project. 
 1. Add MapKit to your app target's `Link Binary With Libraries` build phase.
 1. At a minimum, `#import MBXMapKit.h` and instantiate an `MBXMapView` in your code using the `-initWithFrame:mapID:` initializer and an `NSString` made from your **Map ID** obtained above.

# API overview

MBXMapKit works identically to Apple's MapKit, since it's a subclass derivative, so check out [Apple's MapKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference) for details on getting starting. In addition, MBXMapKit has several added features: 

 * The ability to set a `mapID` in order to control the map appearance with any MapBox map. 
 * The ability to configure hiding or showing of Apple's default maps under the MapBox map. 
 * The ability to control the offline map tile caching duration of the MapBox map. 
 * The ability to swap in a completely custom offline map tile caching system. 

For more details on these features, please consult the [full API documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api). 

### Tile caching

MapBox offers unrestricted control for caching our maps such as [MapBox Streets](/maps) on mobile devices with MBXMapKit, supporting both app developers who want fine-grained control of app storage size and performance, as well as for users who want the optimum use of bandwidth and the best performance for the maps in an app.

- **You may** cache maps as much as you'd like.
- **You may** cache maps for as long as you'd like.
- **You may not** run a proxy or intermediate cache between MapBox and devices.
- **You may not** further redistribute maps from a device cache.

For the full details see our [Terms of Service](http://mapbox.com/tos).

### Attribution

You must comply with the licensing terms of any map data in your application, including [MapBox Streets](/help/#provide_proper_attribution_when_required) or other MapBox maps if used. 

### Retina support

[MapBox Streets](/maps) has retina tile support that can be utilized by MBXMapKit. This brings high-DPI display support for devices such as the iPhone 4 and newer, retina iPads, and retina Macs. 

Retina tiles use an enhanced look including wider streets and enlarged labels. The resulting image on retina-capable devices is incredibly sharp. Here's a side-by-side comparison up close:

You don't need to do anything special to support retina devices. MapBox automatically adds the `@2x` suffix to map tile requests and the platform automatically adjusts the tile content as necessary.
